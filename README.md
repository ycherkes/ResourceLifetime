# ResourceLifetime

`DisposableGroup` Represents a group of disposable resources that are disposed together.

The purpose is the same as [CompositeDisposable](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive/blob/main/Rx.NET/Source/src/System.Reactive/Disposables/CompositeDisposable.cs)

But it supports both IDisposable and IAsyncDisposable.
